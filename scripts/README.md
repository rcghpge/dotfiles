# scripts

This is a collection of Bash and Powershell scripts for Linux, WSL, and Windows for now. Example usage will be added as the repository grows

---

### Windows Powershell `optimize-wsl-vhd.ps1`

Optimize VHD's on Windows for storage bloat:
```bash
Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope Process
# pass a -nb or -noBackup flag to skip generating a backup
.\optimize-wsl-vhd.ps1 -nb 
```

---

### Bash (Linux / WSL) on Windows `windows.sh` 

Bootstrap script for dev environments:
```bash
bash windows.sh
```

Supports both Ubuntu/Debian and Arch Linux (including ArchWSL).
Automatically detects distro and architecture (x86_64, aarch64) and installs system-specific dev tools.
Should work on native-Ubuntu/Debian and Arch Linux

---

### JupyterLab `install_jupyter.sh`

Installs JupyterLab inside a virtual environment (~/venvs/jupyter) with optional browser auto-launch support.

ðŸ“¦ Usage:
```bash
# Standard install (will prompt for browser preference)
./install_jupyter.sh

# Force install with browser auto-launch
./install_jupyter.sh --with-browser

# Force install without browser auto-launch
./install_jupyter.sh --no-browser
```

ðŸ’¡ Notes:
On Arch Linux, make sure xdg-utils is installed for browser auto-launch.

On WSL, the script will use wslview if available.

Adds Jupyter to ~/.local/bin for convenience.

You can launch JupyterLab anytime with:
```bash
jupyter lab
```
