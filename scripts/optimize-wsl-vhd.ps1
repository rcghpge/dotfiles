# optimize-wsl-vhd.ps1
<#
.SYNOPSIS
  Optimize WSL2 VHDX Linux files/filesystems and optionally back them up.

.DESCRIPTION
  This script finds all ext4.vhdx files related to WSL2 Linux distributions and
  compacts them using Optimize-VHD to reclaim disk space. By default, it
  creates a backup of the VHDX before shrinking it unless a -noBackup
  (or -nb) flag is passed.

.PARAMETER noBackup
  Skip creation of the ext4-backup.vhdx file before optimization.

.EXAMPLE
  PS> ./optimize-wsl-vhd.ps1
  Prompts for a WSL disk and creates a backup before shrinking it.

  PS> ./optimize-wsl-vhd.ps1 -noBackup
  Prompts for a WSL disk and shrinks it without creating a backup.
